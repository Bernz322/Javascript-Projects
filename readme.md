# Compilation of my JavaScript Practice Projects

## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is a compilation of all my simple javascript projects with the goal of enhancing my understanding of the language itself and preparing myself to the backend stuffs of Web Development.

## Contents

This contains projects/ features that are commonly seen and used on the frontend side of web development like Dark Mode, Hamburger Menu, Animations, Form Validations and simple projects like Typing games, Calculator, Quizzes and Music/ Video players on the client-side. Although those mentioned projects are already good, I wanna prepare myself to the backend side of Web Development. With this in mind, Javascript projects incorporated with API's will be present on this repository and will be the most focused projects.
